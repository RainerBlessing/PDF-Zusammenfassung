We will now add a Summarizer that integrates (mocked) with OpenAI through LangChain4j. However, we won’t add real API calls yet.

1. Create a “Summarizer” interface with a method:
   - “String summarize(String fullText)”

2. Create a “OpenAiSummarizer” class that implements “Summarizer”. For now:
   - In “summarize”, mock the behavior of calling OpenAI GPT.
   - Return a placeholder string, e.g., “This is a mocked summary.”
   - We will integrate real OpenAI calls in a later step.

3. Write “OpenAiSummarizerTest”:
   - Test that calling summarize with some sample text returns the placeholder string.
   - Test that if the text is empty, the summarizer still returns a valid summary message (like “No content to summarize.”)

4. Ensure the Summarizer concept is modular. We’ll swap the mocked call with a real GPT call next time.
